# Is My Train Delayed

This web application is project meant to provide an alternative display of the information you can find on the GO Transit website. This project was originally conceived _before_ GO Transit did an overhaul of their UI and information architecture design, so it really isn't as bad as it once was.

Still, I think that what this application aims to do is provide a slice of the functionality from the GO Transit website in a simpler and more digestable way.

## Tech Stack

In all honesty, this little application is completely over-engineered. I did this on purpose, however, to be able to explore different technologies and improve my own learning. The technology stack includes:
- Heroku, for setting up a deployment pipeline and running the server
- Node, for running the very minimal server on Heroku that serves the application
- Angular, for managing the core of the application's interface, logic, navigation, etc
- Ngrx, for managing the state of the application
- Sass, for styling the application's interface
