We plan to begin construction in spring 2019, when the weather is warmer, and finish in summer 2019. You can still access the bus loop and station building via the south parking lot driveway off Southdown Road. It will take you an extra 5-10 minutes to walk around compared to using the bridge so please give yourself extra time getting to the station.<br>",
